    > Responsiveness. 
    > Highly customizable. 
    > Extremely user-centric. 
    > Top-notch support. 
    > Cross-browser compatibility. 
    > JavaScript plugins to your rescue.

2.What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work? 
Ans.
    Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system.
    Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be nested,
    most layouts do not require a nested container.
    
    Bootstrap comes with three different containers:

    .container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
    .container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints
    .container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint

*Default container
Our default .container class is a responsive, fixed-width container, meaning its max-width changes at each breakpoint.

<div class="container">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>

*Responsive containers
Responsive containers allow you to specify a class that is 100% wide until the specified breakpoint is reached, 
after which we apply max-widths for each of the higher breakpoints. For example, .container-sm is 100% wide to 
start until the sm breakpoint is reached, where it will scale up with md, lg, xl, and xxl.


<div class="container-sm">100% wide until small breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-md">100% wide until medium breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-lg">100% wide until large breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-xl">100% wide until extra large breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-xxl">100% wide until extra extra large breakpoint</div>


3.What are the default Bootstrap text settings?
Ans.
    Bootstrap 4 uses a default font-size of 16px, and its line-height is 1.5. The default font-family is "Helvetica Neue", 
    Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif. In addition, all <p> elements have margin-top: 0 and margin-bottom: 1rem (16px by default).


Example
h1 Bootstrap heading (2.5rem = 40px)
h2 Bootstrap heading (2rem = 32px)
h3 Bootstrap heading (1.75rem = 28px)
h4 Bootstrap heading (1.5rem = 24px)
h5 Bootstrap heading (1.25rem = 20px)
h6 Bootstrap heading (1rem = 16px)

4.What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?
Ans.
    Bootstrap's grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. It's built with flexbox and is fully responsive.

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm">
      One of three columns
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm">
      One of three columns
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm">
      One of three columns
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


5.What is the difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5?

    Bootstrap v5.x

6.What is a Button Group, and what is the class for a basic Button Group? 
Ans.
   Button groups allow multiple buttons to be stacked together on a single line. This is useful when you want to place items like alignment
   buttons together. You can add on optional JavaScript radio and checkbox style behavior with Bootstrap Button Plugin. This class is used 
   for a basic button group.

This class is used for a basic button group.
       class="btn-group"

example
      <div class = "btn-group">
           <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button1</button>
           <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button2</button>
      </div>

7.How can you use Bootstrap to make thumbnails?
Ans.
    Bootstrap - Thumbnails
        1. Add an <a> tag with the class of . thumbnail around an image.
        2. This adds four pixels of padding and a gray border.
        3. On hover, an animated glow outlines the image.


8.In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?
Ans.
     that Bootstrap 4 now uses flexbox, instead of floats, to handle the layout. The Flexible Box Layout Module,
      makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

9.How can one create an alert in Bootstrap? 
Ans.
    Bootstrap provides an easy way to create predefined alert messages:

         ×Success! This alert box indicates a successful or positive action.
         ×Info! This alert box indicates a neutral informative change or action.
         ×Warning! This alert box indicates a warning that might need attention.
         ×Danger! This alert box indicates a dangerous or potentially negative action.

 Alerts are created with the .alert class, followed by one of the four contextual classes .alert-success, .alert-info,
 .alert-warning or .alert-danger:

example;-



<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Bootstrap Example</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">

  <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

<div class="container">
  <h2>Alerts</h2>
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <strong>Success!</strong> This alert box could indicate a successful or positive action.
  </div>
  <div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Info!</strong> This alert box could indicate a neutral informative change or action.
  </div>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <strong>Warning!</strong> This alert box could indicate a warning that might need attention.
  </div>
  <div class="alert alert-danger">
    <strong>Danger!</strong> This alert box could indicate a dangerous or potentially negative action.
  </div>
</div>

10.
Ans.
    A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers,
    a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. 
    If you're familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails.
